title: Dissecting the 'Name-Brand' CSS Conventions
talk: Dissecting the 'Name-Brand' **CSS Conventions**
description: |
  How do we write code that is modular & maintainable,
  in a language designed to be systematic & contextual?
  Over the years developers have explored a range of techniques,
  frameworks, and naming conventions to achieve that goal.
  We'll look at what these systems have in common, where they differ,
  and how they are informed by CSS itself.
