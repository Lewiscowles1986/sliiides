title: Cascade Aligned Programming
talk: |
  **Cascade Aligned** Programming
description: |
  What does it mean to style a medium
  that must adapt universally across languages,
  devices, operating systems, user-preferences, browsers, and interfaces?
  The result is CSS,
  a programming language unlike any other --
  built around a resilient “cascade” of hints & suggestions
  for the browser to interpret in each context.
  How would we describe a cascade-informed, approach to writing code?
