  Cascading **Layers of !mportance**

description: |
  Cascade Layers have the potential to fundamentally change
  how we write styles.
  This is a deep-dive into the cascade,
  where Cascade Layers fit,
  how `!important` actually works,
  and how it will change our tools & conventions.
  We'll also look at what's coming
  over the next few years
  with `@scope` and proximity.
