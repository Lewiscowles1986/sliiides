# Cascade Intro ---------
- pre: Container Queries
  title: |
    & **The Future of CSS**
  script: |
    I'm here to talk about the future of CSS,
    but in order to understand where we're going ‚Äî
- pre: The _Present of CSS_
  script: |
    we need to understand where we are ‚Äì
- pre: The _Past of CSS_
  script: |
    And how we got here.

- pre: CSS exists
  title: For **Two Reasons**
  script: |
    In my mind CSS exists for two primary reasons

- pre: 1. _CSS_ makes
  title: Styles **Responsive**
  script: |
    First,
    CSS makes styles responsive ‚Äì

- pre: |
    `@media`
  title: |
    _`min-width`_
  script: |
    and not just to
    dimensions of a viewport --

- pre: |
    `@media`
  title: |
    _`prefers-reduced-motion`_
  script: |
    But user preferences --

- pre: |
    `@media`
  title: |
    _`hover`_
  script: |
    and device interfaces.

    [WWW HyperMedia Browser](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/)
    & *Editor*
  script: |
    When Sir Tim
    and the team at CERN
    released the first
    hypermedia browser
    It was designed for the NeXT machine,
    with a fancy graphic interface
- img: process/ibm-pc.jpg
  alt: Old IBM desktop
  position: top
  script: |
    But you can't make a web that's "world-wide",
    by saying "it works on my machine"
    and everyone else is an "edge-case".
- img: no-harm/line-mode.jpg
  alt: The second browser, a text-only terminal

    [Line Mode Browser](http://line-mode.cern.ch/www/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html),
    developed by **Nicola Pellow**
  script: |
    So right away they release a second browser,
    designed to work on any terminal with an internet connection.
- quote: |
    Web **for all**. Web **on everything**.
  cite: W3C [Mission Statement](w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#principles)
  script: |
    This becomes the _mission statement_ of the web --
    web for all, web on everything.
- img: unfriendly/braille.jpg
  alt: Braille interface and headphones
  script: |
    That includes assistive devices --
- img: unfriendly/agnesscott/smart-home.png
  alt: Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod
  script: |
    And non-visual media --
    always with the end-user in control of the outcome.

- quote:
    Provide **hints** that the browser **may or may not use**.
  cite: H√•kon Lie
  script: |
    We provide hints and suggestions,
    semantic clues,
    but only the browser
    can put it all together.

- title: The **Cascade**
  script: |
    And the cascade describes that process --

- quote: |
    **An ordered list (cascade) of style sheets** ‚Ä¶
    can be referenced from the same document.
  cite: H√•kon Lie
  caption: https://w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html
  script: |
    by accepting style sheets
    from everyone involved --

- quote: |
    The **user/browser** specifies _initial preferences_
    and **hands the remaining influence over** to the document.
  cite: H√•kon Lie
  caption: https://w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html
  script: |
    _Browsers_ & _users_ establish
    global defaults and preferences across the web,
    and then we fill in the details
    of our particular site

- title: Cascade **Origins**
  md: |
    - üé® **Author** (Document)
    - üë• **User** Preferences
    - üñ• **User Agent** (Browser)
  script: |
    These are the primary "cascade origins" --
    each one representing a
    different set of needs and concerns,
    different perspectives,
    sometimes in conflict.

- pre: The _Cascade_
  title: Resolves **Merge Conflicts**
  script: |
    The rules of cascade & inheritance
    describe how to merge all three,
    and resolve any conflicts.

- md: |
    1. üé® **Author** (Document)
    2. üë• **User** Preferences
    3. üñ• **User Agent** (Browser)
  script: |
    By default
    user preferences override the browser defaults,
    and (for better or worse)
    we're allowed to override everyone.

- quote: |
    If conflicts arise **the user should have the last word**,
    but one should also allow the author to attach style hints.
  cite: H√•kon Lie
  caption: https://w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html
  script: |
    But when things really get heated,
    when it really matters,
    the user and browser can insist --

- title: ‚ùó**important**
  sub: A balance of power
  script: |
    That some styles are
    more important than others --

- md: |
    1. ==‚ùóüñ• User Agent **Important**==
    2. ==‚ùóüë• User **Important**==
    3. ==‚ùóüé® Author **Important**==
    4. üé® Author Styles
    5. üë• User Preferences
    6. üñ• User Agent Defaults
  script: |
    Creating _important origins_
    that cascade in reverse order:
    Important author styles aren't that special --
    that's us in the middle --
    but users can override us when they need to,
    and the browser finally decides
    what's out of bounds,
    what's possible on this device,
    and what features are supported in what ways.

- pre: 2. Style*Sheets*
  title: Make Styles **Reusable**
  script: |
    The second goal of CSS
    is to make our design objects reusable...

- lang: html
  code: |
    <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">‚Ä¶</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">‚Ä¶</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">‚Ä¶</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">‚Ä¶</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">‚Ä¶</FONT></P>
  script: |
    Instead of repeating the same styles
    over and over in our HTML

- title: CSS **Selectors**
  code: |
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  script: |
    We can use selectors to apply styles broadly ‚Äì

- pre: We use
  title: |
    **Classes** & **Attributes**
  caption: |
    ü§î Lingo taken from Object Oriented Programming
  script: |
    Creating patterns
    based on things like
    classes and attributes --

- pre: Combine them
  title: To **Compose Objects**
  script: |
    Which we can combine,
    to compose re-usable objects --

    **Component** Libraries

  title: |
    **Nicole** Sullivan
  sub: |
    2009 [**Object Oriented CSS**](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss)
  script: |
    CSS is object-oriented to the core,
    but it is also declarative, contextual, and resilient --
    features of the cascade.
    CSS is cascade-oriented.

- title: üí• Conflict!
  css: |
    button          { background: gray; }
    .action         { background: darkblue; }
    [type=‚Äúsubmit‚Äù] { background: darkgreen; }
    #send           { background: maroon; }
  script: |
    And selectors create another potential conflict
    for the cascade to resolve.
    Since we can use multiple different selectors
    to target the same element --

- title: Selector **Specificity**
  caption: |
    [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic):
    a practical assumption
    that approximates the desired goal
  script: |
    The cascade needs to determine a winner,
    using a clever heuristic called specificity --
    based on how narrowly a selector has been targeted.
    Again, each selector type
    represents a different goal.

- pre: |
    universal/type ¬ª
  title: Global **Defaults**
  script: |
    The most generic selectors,
    help us paint in broad strokes
    to establish low-priority defaults --
- pre: |
    attrs/classes ¬ª
  title: Common **Patterns**
  script: |
    Classes and attributes
    allow us to describe
    higher-priority patterns,
    and make up the majority of our styles --
- pre: |
    ID/style ¬ª
  title: Singular **Overrides**
  script: |
    Then one-off ID's are both
    the most narrowly targeted,
    and the highest priority.
- md: |
    1. *Unique* `#ID`s
    2. *Reusable* `.class`es & `[attributes]`
    3. *Element* `type`s
    4. *Universal* `*`
  script: |
    One ID will always override any number of attributes,
    and on down the list.
    It's not perfect,
    but it's an approximation
    of the layers in our code.

- title: We Have A üí•**Problem**üí•
  script: |
    Until things get complicated...

- title: Especially "**At Scale**"
  script: |
    As our projects become larger and more complex
    with more distributed teams
    and third-party integrations,
    there are _a lot_ of situations
    that don't fit the rule --

- css: |
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> tr > td,
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> * > tr > td,
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> tr > th,
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> * > tr > th,
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> td,
    table[rules]:not([rules=""])> th
    {
      border-width: thin;
      border-style: none;
    }
  cation: |
    Firefox user-agent styles (`resource://gre-resources/html.css`)
  script: |
    Some low-priority defaults are very specific --

- css: |
    [hidden] {
      display: none !important;
    }
  script: |
    While some generic attributes,
    really ought to have more weight behind them.

- md: |
    1. ~~*Unique* `#ID`s~~
    2. ==*Reusable* `.class`es & `[attributes]`==
    3. ~~*Element* `type`s~~
    4. ~~*Universal* `*`~~
  script: |
    And out of all these selectors,
    there's only one that we can
    both _customize_ **and** _reuse_.
    Classes & attributes.

- css: |
    .block .element.modifier { /* 3 */ }
    .block__element--modifier { /* 1 */ }
  script: |
    So we spend a lot of our time
    fighting over _how many attributes_
    should be in a selector --

    matches carefully crafted layers of _intent_ --
    building up from global abstractions
    to components and overrides.

- title: ‚ùó**important**
  sub: A balance of power
  script: |
    And throwing importance like a grenade
    when we get stuck,

- css: |
    .bootstrap-thing {
      font-weight: bold !important;
    }
  script: |
    Or if one part of the system
    doesn't play by the same rules.

# Layers ----------------
- section: |
    Cascade **Layers**
  caption: |
    [Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/)
  script: |
    So that brings us to our first new feature:
    Cascade Layers.
    Jen Simmons and I suggested this at the end of 2019,
    it was approved by the CSS Working Group last February,
    and I expect browsers to start implementing it this year.

- img: patterns/itcss-layers.png
  fit: contain
  background: white
  caption: |
    [**Inverted Triangle**](http://technotif.com/manage-large-css-projects-with-itcss/)
    CSS (ITCSS), by Harry Roberts
  script: |
    Very similar to CSS origins,
    we're again creating layers
    that represent different perspectives,
    from different parts of a system,
    and potentially different teams on a project.

- title: Stacked in **Layers**
  md: |
    1. Components?
    2. Themes?
    3. Frameworks?
    4. Resets?
  script: |
    But we get to define these layers ourselves,
    as authors --
    for things like resets, defaults,
    frameworks, themes, components,
    utilities --
    anything we want,
    in whatever order we need.

- md: |
    1. ‚ùó**Important** Resets
    3. ‚ùó**Important** Themes
    4. ‚ùó**Important** Components
    5. Components
    6. Themes
    8. Resets
  script: |
    And the `important` flag works as intended,
    when it becomes necessary for a lower layer
    to insist on something,
    and punch above it's weight.
    But we're not actually adding new origins here,
    so it may be better to think of them as
    customizable _layers of specificity_.

- css: |
    @import url(headings.css) layer(default);
  script: |
    We can define a layer,
    give it a name,
    and add styles to it
    using either a layer function on the import rule --
- css: |
    @layer default {
      audio[controls] { display: block; }
      [hidden] { display: none !important; }
    }
  script: |
    Or by nesting styles inside the new at-layer rule --
- css: |
    @import url(headings.css) layer(default);

    @layer default {
      audio[controls] { display: block; }
      [hidden] { display: none !important; }
    }
  script: |
    -- Or both. Here we're creating a "default" layer
    with the `headings.css` import,
    and using the at-rule
    to add a few more styles to the same
    "default" layer.

- css: |
    @layer default { /* lowest */ }
    @layer theme { /* higher */ }
    @layer components { /* highest */ }
  script: |
    Layers stack in the order they were first defined,
    with the highest layer taking precedence,
    no matter what specificity is used
    for the selectors inside.
    Specificity only matters _inside_ each layer.

- css: |
    @layer framework {
      .menu > .dropdown > .item {
        background: whitesmoke;
      }
    }

    @layer override {
      .my-menu-item {
        background: lightcyan;
      }
    }
  script: |
    In this case, the override layer wins
    even though the selector inside
    has a lower specificity.

- css: |
    @layer default { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer theme { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer components { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer default { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer components { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
  script: |
    But we don't need to keep all our styles in that order.
    Once a layer has been established,
    we can add to it from anywhere in our code.
    The priority is based on when the layer name
    _first appears_.

- css: |
    @layer default;
    @layer theme;
    @layer components;

    @layer default {
      * { box-sizing: border-box; }
    }
  script: |
    We can even use the at-layer rule with _only_ a name
    to establish our order up front,
    so we don't have to worry about the actual code order --

- css: |
    @layer default, theme, components;

    @layer default {
      * { box-sizing: border-box; }
    }
  script: |
    And there's a shorthand syntax to make that even easier,
    using a comma-separated list of layer names.

- css: |
    @layer default, tools, theme, components;
    @import url(tools.css) layer(tools);
  script: |
    One of the goals here
    is to make it so that we as authors
    get to define exactly where
    third-party tools belong
    in our layering.
    No matter what specificity those tools use internally,
    or whatever layers they create,
    we can always override them
    without resorting to specificity hacks.

- css: |
    /* tools.css */
    @layer theme { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer components { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
  script: |
    And this also gives
    framework or component-library authors
    a way to provide layers
    we can hook into --

- css: |
    @import url(tools.css) layer(tools);

    @layer tools.theme { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
    @layer tools.custom { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
  script: |
    Either directly,
    or by wrapping those layers into a contained namespace.
    We can create or access
    "nested" or "name-spaced" layers
    using a dot-notation to combine the names.

- css: |
    @layer tools {
      @layer custom {
        /* tools.custom */
      }
    }
  script: |
    Or we can actually nest the layer rules.

- title: |
    **Unlayered** Styles Win
  script: |
    Of course,
    we don't have to put all our styles in a layer.
    Un-layered styles will work the same way they always have,
    and will always belong to an implied
    "highest layer"
    above all the others.

- title: |
    More Cascade **Control**
  script: |
    This gives us a lot more control
    over our corner of the cascade,
    so we're not totally reliant
    on selector specificity
    and code-order to determine
    what takes precedence.

- title: |
    Fewer **Hacks**
  script: |
    Hopefully allowing us to replace
    all our specificity & importance hacks
    with more clearly defined patterns.

# Scope ----------------
- section: |
    **Scoped** Styles
  script: |
    The next feature is also about how selectors work.
    With "scope",
    we're trying to address two issues
    that come up regularly,
    and drive people to use tools & conventions
    like BEM syntax or CSS-in-JS.

- pre: 1. Avoid
  title: |
    **Naming** Conflicts
  sub: (across _large teams_ & _projects_)
  script: |
    The first goal is to avoid
    naming conflicts as our projects grow.

- pre: 2. By
  title: Expressing **Membership**
  sub: (through _lower boundaries_ & _proximity_)
  script: |
    Which we can solve
    by focusing on our second goal:
    expressing "membership" or "ownership"
    in our selectors.

- css: |
    .title { /* global */ }
    .post .title { /* nested */ }
  caption: |
    _Membership_ is distinct from _ancestry_
  script: |
    While nested selectors
    might seem like a way to
    express membership --
    in this case
    a title that is inside a post --

- css: |
    .title { /* global */ }
    .post .title { /* nested */ }

    .post__title { /* BEM */ }
  caption: |
    _Membership_ is distinct from _ancestry_
  script: |
    That's not quite the same thing
    as _a post-title_.
    The first one only describes a nested structure,
    but the second describes
    a more clear membership in a component pattern.
    Not _all the titles in a post_,
    just the title that _belongs to_ the post.

- css: |
    .post__title { /* BEM */ }
    .title[data-JKGHJ] { /* Vue */ }
  script: |
    We don't have a good way to convey that
    using our current CSS selectors,
    unless we invent a new unique name
    for every kind of title,
    based on what it belongs to --
    either manually using a convention like BEM,
    or automated with JavaScript compilers.

- html: |
    <h2 class="title post__title">
  script: |
    And if we want some global title styles,
    we end up using multiple classes --
    and hoping the more targeted pattern will override
    the global pattern.

- img: csswg/components.jpg
  alt: wireframe of a site, with multiple nested components
  fit: contain
  background: '#e5e5e5'
  caption: |
    A "donut scope" with
    _lower boundaries_
    similar to shadow-DOM `slots`
  script: |
    Another way to think about this is
    to say that some components
    have lower boundaries --
    the component itself is a "donut"
    with a hole in the middle for content.
    We should be able to style a tab component,
    or a media-object,
    without worrying that we might accidentally
    style _everything inside_ it by mistake.

- pre: Different from
  title: Shadow-DOM **Encapsulation**
  script: |
    This might sound similar to shadow-DOM encapsulation,
    and there is certainly cross-over
    between scope & encapsulation.

- img: csswg/widget.jpg
  fit: contain
  alt: |
    Diagram shows a widget with solid boundaries,
    which cannot be penetrated
    in either direction
    (global styles can't get in, widget styles can't get out)
  background: white
  caption: |
    **Encapsulation**
    is designed for _isolated DOM widgets_
  script: |
    But the Shadow-DOM is designed
    for more highly-isolated widgets.
    This creates a 1-to-1 relationship,
    where boundaries are defined in the DOM,
    each component has a single scope,
    and styles are isolated from getting in or out.

- pre: Build-tools
  title: Provide **Scoped Styles**
  sub: BEM, CSS Modules, Vue, JSX, Stylable, etc
  script: |
    While encapsulation can be useful,
    it's very different from the lighter-touch
    "scope" that we get from existing
    build-tools and conventions --

- img: csswg/scoped.jpg
  alt: |
    Diagram shows a component with porous boundaries,
    all styles can penetrate, or establish their own lower boundaries
  fit: contain
  background: white
  caption: |
    **Scope**
    is designed for _a unified system_
  script: |
    Where scopes reference the DOM,
    but they are able to overlap,
    and integrate more smoothly
    with global design systems.
    Different styles can be given
    different or overlapping boundaries,
    while global styles continue to apply globally.
    This provides us with a much lower-impact alternative,
    where scopes are defined in CSS,
    and can be re-used across components,
    or overlap & cascade together.

- css: |
    @scope (.media) to (.content) {
      img { /* only images that are "in scope" */ }
    }
  caption: |
    [CSSWG Scope Issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5809)
  script: |
    So we're proposing an at-scope rule,
    that accepts both a scope-root selector
    (in this case `media`)
    and a lower-boundary selector
    (in this case `content`).
    Any selectors inside the at-rule
    only apply _between_ the root
    and the lower-boundary.
    In this case we're styling images inside media,
    unless they are also inside the media content.

- md: |
    ```css
    .light-theme a { color: purple; }
    .dark-theme a { color: plum; }
    ```
  caption: |
    _DOM Proximity_
    is similar to _inheritance_
  script: |
    We can also talk about this
    in terms of _proximity_.
    These two selectors apply to links
    inside a light-theme or dark-theme class.
    And that works great,
    as long as we never nest one theme inside the other.
    Since our selectors both have the same specificity,
    and _ancestor proximity_ is not part of the cascade --

    dark-theme will always override light theme
    in nested situations.

- css: |
    @scope ([data-theme=light]) to ([data-theme]) {
      a { color: purple; }
    }
    @scope ([data-theme=dark]) to ([data-theme]) {
      a { color: plum; }
    }
  script: |
    We can solve that problem using lower-boundaries,
    so that themes never bleed into each other --

- css: |
    @scope ([data-theme=light]) {
      a { color: purple; }
    }
    @scope ([data-theme=dark]) {
      a { color: plum; }
    }
  script: |
    But I think it would also make sense for
    scope proximity to be added as part of the scope feature.
    When specificity is equal,
    we would default to using the "closer" scope-root.
    This part of the spec is still being debated.

# Container Queries ----------------
- section: |
    **Container** Queries
  script: |
    And that brings us to the real reason we're here.
    Container Queries.

  caption: Change card layout at a media-query breakpoint
  script: |
    People have been asking for this feature
    since Media Queries were implemented
    more than 10 years ago.
    Media Queries allow us
    to change the layout of a component
    when the viewport is above or below a particular size --

- img: csswg/mq-cards-broken.jpg
  alt: |
    (viewport width > 45em) -
    cards both using large layout,
    but one is in a small sidebar container
  fit: contain
  background: white
  caption: Card layouts based on viewport size, not container
  script: |
    But if we put that same component
    inside different-size containers...
    That's not what we want.

- img: csswg/cq-cards.jpg
  alt: |
    (container width > 45em) -
    cards each using the appropriate layout
    for the container it is in
  fit: contain
  background: white
  caption: Card layouts based on container size
  script: |
    Ideally, each component
    should be able to
    respond to the container it's in --

  alt: |

    inside the main container,

    No matter how those containers are nested.

      _limited to paint_
  caption: |
    Different tradeoffs, worth pursuing both
  script: |
    At first this seemed impossible,
    but there's been a lot of people over the years,
    laying the groundwork to make it happen --
    and last year two proposals emerged,
    showing different ways we might pull this off.
    Both are interesting,
    but David Baron's approach has the most momentum right now,
    and I've been working on it
    to flesh out some of the details,
    and start writing a specification.

- img: csswg/cq-nested-containers.jpg
  alt: |
    We need to define the containers
    for our cards to query
  fit: contain
  background: white
  script: |
    This proposal has two parts:
    the containers, and the queries.
    So the first thing we need to do
    is define our containers.
    And make this feature possible,
    without creating infinite loops,
    containers need to be... contained.

- pre: CSS _layout_
  title: |
    **Context** & **Content**
  script: |
    One of the coolest responsive features in CSS,
    which we don't talk about nearly enough,
    is the way we calculate layout
    based on both context and content.
    Add more content,
    and a container with try to grow,
    but only as much as the context allows.
    That's very cool,
    but if you add container queries,
    it becomes an infinite loop.

- pre: 1. Establishing **Containers**
  css: |
    .container {
      contain: size layout;
    }
  script: |
    So we have a way to turn that off,
    using the `contain` property.
    Size containment turns off content-based sizing,
    so our containers need an explicit
    or context-based size.

- pre: 2D size containment
  title: Is **Too Restrictive**
  caption: |
    Need a flexible dimension ("Be afraid of heights")
  script: |
    That would be real limiting
    if we always had to contain both
    height & width.

- pre: 1D size containment
  title: |
    `contain: `_`inline-size`_
  caption: |
    See the
    [CSSWG issue for single-axis containment](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1031)
  script: |
    But most layouts work by containing the `width`,
    or the inline-dimension,
    and allowing the `height` to grow or shrink
    with content.
    So we're adding an option to make that explicit.
    Contain inline-size.

- css: |
    .sidebar, main, .grid-item {
      /* contain: size layout style; */
      contain: inline-size layout style;
    }
  script: |
    In our current proposal,
    applying the appropriate containment --
    layout and 1d or 2d size --
    creates a container.

- pre: 2. **Querying** Containers
  css: |
    @container (min-width: 40em) {
      .card { /* ... */¬†}
      h2 { /* ... */¬†}
    }
  caption: |
    Each element queries the
    _nearest ancestor container_
  script: |
    Now we can write queries,
    and they look exactly like media-queries,
    but with at-container instead of at-media.
    And each element will query
    the size of it's nearest ancestor container.

- pen: Container Vs Media Queries
  id: NWRJpQo
  script: |
    But why don't I just show you?
    I've set up two containers on the page,
    each with one card using a media-query,
    and one card using a container query.
    The media queries all trigger at the same time,
    but the container queries
    depend on the size of the container.

    My coworker David Herron,
    made this one showing
    the same blockquote
    with three different designs
    based on the size of the container.

- pen: Flexbox cards, with Container Queries
  id: mdRVMbp
  script: |
    In some cases,
    like inside flexbox or grid,
    there is no outside container
    that will tell us the actual space available
    for each item.
    But we can get around that by adding a container
    around each component --
    in this case div.card is wrapping each article.
    The outer div establishes a container,
    and the inner article can query it.

    Of course, we can also get creative!
    Jhey Tompkins inspired these interactive blinds
    that get smaller as the container gets bigger.
    Because CSS doesn't have to be practical
    to be awesome.
